## Intro
PoX is a novel consensus algorithm, which takes bitcoin from miners and gives to stackers


**Miners** instead of burning bitcoin they send these bitcoins to **Stackers** who lock their STX to support network security.


Smart contracts can be 1st class **stackers** and that while it might seem a simple idea in the beginning it's quite an underused feature, with so much potential

- Electing a btc address for rewards
- Having a controlled pool (different from delegating) where logic rules supreme
- Having funds for different causes one case of which can be collective student loan forgiveness contract which could collect a 100 STX from all participant and circulate rewards between all participants' btc addresses
- Collateralized pools where a stacker would pledge payment of X and provide half of X in STX in the beginning so that if they decide not to payout the remaining of the pledge the delegator would get half of that reward (whether early or after the cycle ends).
- Mutual funds for communities who want to collectively support each other with BTC instead of one whale having so much STX the community can collectively have a large amount of STX pooling it together and using the BTC for whichever community projects they aspire to.


**Decent delegate is a just a use case of many cases where logic would define how we use this novel algorithm**
